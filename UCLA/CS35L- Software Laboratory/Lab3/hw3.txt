Q1. The patch essentially removes the line because 
there was the exact same expression right next to 
it. It made it cleaner. It also helps to avoid redundancy. 

Q2. There could be an issue for users that English is not first language and they do not use English. Also, date format is not the same in every country.

Q3. We will get an index error since there is no line in the file to read it from. For example index[0] wants to get the first line and there is not first line to get, so it gives an error.

Q4. It gives the following error:
	File "shuf.py", line 65
   	 except IOError as (errno, strerror):
			^
	SyntaxError: invalid syntax

I searched on Google the reason for this error is that it should be changed to 
"except IOError as err;" 
Python 3 no longer allows what is
known as "iteration over exceptions" unlike python 2 which I tested for the first time and did not give such an error.
