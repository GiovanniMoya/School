1. Get Coreutils 8.29 source code compressed tarball, signature and keyring
	
	wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
	wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
	wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

2. Verified its signature with the GNU Keyring
	gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
3. Get the following errors:
	gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
	gpg: /u/cs/ugrad/mirabzad/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
	gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
	gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
	gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
	gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
	gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
4. Unzip the tar file
	tar -xf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
5. Then go to the coreutils-8.29 directory 
	cd coreutils-8.29
6. Then run ./configure with --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/mirabzad/temp to my desired path
	./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/mirabzad/temp
7. Compile the source code into binary
	make
8. Move the binary to desired place under coreutils file
	make install
9. Reproduce the bug
	cd ~/temp
10. Run ls -aA
	As expected, got the bug 
	. .. 
11. Copy paste message #10 in a file called patch.diff
	emacs patch.diff
12. Then apply patchin with a flag p1
	patch -p1 < patch.diff
13. Re-compile it by make: Now, we want to build the patched file. we simply run the make command at the
	highest level of the coreutils-8.29 directory
14. Re-install
	make install

 
The following is the output we get from running make after applying the
patch. Essentially we notice that there are much fewer files being
compiled again as compared to the original make command. We see fewer
leaving/entering commands.

Essentially after applying the patch, it recompiled only the
selected files that had been modified from the original. Note that we only make
the patch and not install it because this way we have the broken version of ls
in the coreutils-8.29/temp folder and the fixed version in the coreutils-8.29/src
folder.
