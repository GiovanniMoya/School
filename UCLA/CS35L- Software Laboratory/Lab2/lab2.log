1.  export LC_ALL='C'
To make sure that we are in standard C locale.

2. sort -u /usr/share/dict/words > words
It sorts all the words in that directory and and put the result in words

3. wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs35L/assign/assign2.html
It gets the html page

   a. tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
      It takes character with ‘A-Za-z' and change them to a new line
   b. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
      The list of words are the same except that this time there would one occurrence of the new line for each character 'A-Za-z'
   c. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
      This would give the same as the previous one except that it has been sorted alphabetically.
   d. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
      tag -u removes y repeats from the previous list
   e. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
      This command reads the file and compare it with the file words
   f. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
      It finds the words not in the words file. -23 shows and it would not display the last two column.
